### Summary of Data Analysis Methods and Techniques Used

Using a combination of data cleaning techniques in programs like Python, PostgresSQl, and SQL we were able to get the necessary data we wanted to analyze from our csv file. We then used the acquired data to take a look at different NBA statistics such as player salaries, ratings, and various other attributes by grouping players together on various javascript charts. 

### Javascript Charts 

We used a variety of javascript charts to display the results of our analysis, and also added an element of interactiveness to each chart. The charts had mulitple views and we were able to use a populations pyramid and radar chart that were really unique. With the populations pyramid chart we were able to use it outside of what it is traditionally meant to display in order to provide a great view of average player salaries by rating and conference. The radar chart allowed us to take a look at the elite players who were in the front running to win the MVP and allowed us to look at the most important stats simutaneously of each player to make a potential MVP selection. 

### HTML Layout 

The layout for our page was designed to display all of our 4 charts with full functionality on the homepage. We also included a navbar element to give our charts indivdual pages with separate analysis on them. In addition to the separate pages for our charts we included a link to our data to lets users see the original data source in a table format.
